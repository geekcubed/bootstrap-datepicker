#Bootstrap Date Picker

##Summary

This project is a fork of the original Bootstrap DatePicker component, which can be found at http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker

There were specific short-comings with that component that I wanted to address. In particular:

 * When navigating between months/years, the 1st of the month was automatically selected and populated in the input
 * There was no support for "nullable" input fields

##Project status

The project is still under development to address the above two requirements. I have no plans to currently move beyond that, however I can see several other avenues for additional developement:

 * Improve/Extend date formats & parsing
 * Add support for selecting Time as well as date
 * Improve extensibility to support additional languages / locales.
